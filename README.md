# Awesome list of Haskell mentors

## To experienced Haskell developers

You have an open project and

- you look for a team to develop,
- or you have many tasks and not enough hands,
- or one head is good, but two is better,
- or you will to share your knowledge,
- or you consider Haskell a worthy language for others.

Then why do not you become a mentor for beginners?

### Feel free to PR!

## To beginner developers

You have already mastered the basics of the language, solved the tasks on CodeWars and you lack reality and usefulness for others.
Then why do not you become a contributor in an open project, where you will be helped?
